Purpose:

Dependencies/Assumptions:
To run this full pipeline you need the following:
-The Sun Grid Engine
-Working executables of: sfs_code, convertSFS_CODE, msstats, R, Python

If those executables are not already in your path, you must add them:
1) create a file called ".bash_profile" in your home directory (if it doesn't exist)
2) add this, substituting the paths to your exectuable:
PATH=$PATH:/home/user/sfs_code/bin/:/home/user/msstats-0.3.1/bin/
export PATH

Directions to run:
1) qsub maize_bs.sh
2) source cleanup.sh
3) Statistics are in order in final_stats.txt. Paramters are in order in parameters.txt.

*Change parameters in generate_params.r
*You can test out those parameters with 'Rscript genereate_params.r 1'. The output will be on the terminal with paramters saved as paramsFile.1

Tricks for analysis

1) make sure you're using the right data. If you're simulating with "--annotate N" then use stats from noncoding windows.
2) make sure your stats are actually comparable: msstats gives theta pi per locus. Your data might have theta pi per base pair. 
3) if your graph is crappy, try reducing the number of values in your posterior.

# This script will take the parameters.txt and final_stats.txt and create a posterior that is graphable in R.
# uses ABCreg

# step 1: cut up parameters.txt to get the right parameters (in this case theta) 

# step 2: cut up final_stats.txt to get the right stats (in this case Pi and TajD)

# step 3: combine these into the prior file

# step 4: obtain data file

# step 5: use ABCreg

# have a way to choose which stats to create data file from?
